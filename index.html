            <h3>Why I became a naturopathic physician</h3>
            <p>As a young adult, I began to suffer from seasonal allergies. In spite of consultations with many
              doctors,
              trials of various prescription and over-the-counter drugs, my condition worsened with each passing year.
              In
              desperation, I sought out alternative therapies where I finally found modalities that truly worked in
              evoking
              healing and effecting a permanent improvement in the quality of my life. This experience convinced me
              that
              I should devote my energies towards helping and educating others to achieve the best health possible
              through
              alternative therapies.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to accomplish this goal, I enrolled at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe,
              Arizona, and graduated
              in 1997 with a doctorate of Naturopathy. You can learn more about my Alma matter by logging onto

            <h3>Emphasis is put on teaching patients
              <br>self-reliant health care strategies.</h3>
            <p>If you are a person who has tried many different doctors and still have no resolution to your problem,
              then
              Naturopathic medicine may be able to help. As a Naturopathic doctor, I am trained in a different paradigm
              than
              the conventional medical doctor.
            </p>
            <p>My aim is to look for the cause of your ailment, not just prescribe palliative measures. Depending upon
              the
              situation, I will order tests that seem unrelated in the conventional model. For example, a patient with
              seasonal
              sinusitis (allergies/hay fever) may be shocked to learn that a stool test for GI pathogens is necessary.
              You
              may ask, "What do bugs in my gut have to do with getting allergy symptoms every spring?" As it turns out,
              a
              lot. If your immune system is busy "24/7" dealing with GI pathogens, then you have very little immune
              reserve
              to fend off the onslaught of pollen in the spring. Once the GI pathogens are identified and eliminated,
              then
              the immune system can perform better and you will have resolved your seasonal sinusitis.</p>
            <p>Food allergies can work in the same way. Many patients need to be tested for both GI pathogens and food
              allergies
              in order to permanently resolve seasonal sinusitis.</p>

            <h3>Naturopathic medicine is not for everyone.</h3>
            <p>If you are only willing to "take something" (a drug or herb) to resolve your ailment, then this type of
              medicine
              may not be for you. A Naturopathic patient must be willing to make the necessary life-style changes in
              order
              to obtain results. This means omitting habits that are contributing to your ill health. Dedication and a
              sincere
              desire to improve are paramount. Patience and diligence are important since results take time to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              As one of my patients, you can expect that I will use all my knowledge and experience to guide you on
              your journey to optimal
              health. You will have my full attention during office visits (no staff interruptions or phone calls). I
              am
              accessible by email and phone whenever a question comes to your mind. Frequent communication is necessary
              in
              order to achieve the desired results, especially when first starting a treatment protocol.</p>

                      <h3>History of Naturopathic Medcine</h3>
                      <p>
                        The roots of Naturopathic medicine go back through medical history to the healing wisdom of
                        many cultures and times. Around
                        the 1900's, practitioners of a variety of medical disciplines combined natural therapeutics in
                        a
                        way they had not been combined before and joined together to form the first Naturopathic
                        professional
                        medical societies.</p>
                      <p>
                        Naturopathic Medicine suffered a decline in the 1940’s and 50’s with the rise and popularity of
                        pharmaceutical drugs and
                        the idea that drugs could eliminate all disease. Natural medicine experienced a resurgence in
                        the
                        last three decades, as a health conscious public began to seek out alternatives to conventional
                        medicine.
                      </p>
                      <p>As a body of knowledge, Naturopathic medicine continues to grow and evolve. It incorporates
                        elements
                        of modern scientific medicine especially in the fields of diagnosis, immunology, clinical
                        nutrition
                        and botanical medicine. As an organized profession, Naturopathic medicine is committed to
                        on-going
                        research and development.</p>

                      <h3>Principles of Naturopathic Medcine</h3>
                      <p>The principles of Naturopathic medicine unite the profession. The following elements are the
                        foundation
                        that Naturopathic medical practice is built upon.</p>
                      <p>
                        <mark>The Healing Power of Nature. </mark>
                        (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) Nature acts powerfully through healing mechanisms in the body and mind
                        to maintain and restore health.
                        Naturopathic physicians work to restore and support these inherent healing systems when they
                        have
                        broken down by using methods, medicines and techniques that are in harmony with natural
                        processes.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <mark>First Do No Harm.</mark>
                        (Primum non nocere) Naturopathic physicians advocate non-invasive treatments which minimize the
                        risks of harmful side-effects.
                        They are also trained to know which patients they can treat safely and which ones they need to
                        refer
                        to other health care practitioners.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <mark>Find the Cause.</mark>
                        (Tolle Causam) Every illness has an underlying cause; often in aspects of the lifestyle, diet
                        or habits of the individual.
                        A Naturopathic physician is trained to find and remove the fundamental reason for a disease.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <mark>Doctor as Teacher.</mark>
                        (Docere) The principal objective of Naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and
                        emphasize self-responsibility for
                        health.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <mark>Treat the Whole Person.</mark>
                        Health or disease arise from a complex interaction of physical, emotional, dietary, genetic,
                        environmental, lifestyle and
                        other factors. Naturopathic physicians treat the whole person, taking these factors into
                        account.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <mark>Preventive Medicine.</mark>
                        The Naturopathic approach to health care can prevent minor illnesses from developing into more
                        serious or chronic degenerative
                        diseases. Patients are taught the principles with which to live a healthy life. By following
                        these
                        principles they can prevent major illnesses.

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>For years I had an enlarged thyroid with a fluid filled cyst. Although my thyroid functioned
                      normally
                      the enlargement sometimes made it difficult to swallow and constantly pressed on my windpipe. An
                      endocrinologist
                      put me on Synthroid to reduce the swelling but it had very little effect, plus I knew it depleted
                      calcium.
                      After my thyroid was aspirated, the size only went down about 30%. At that point the doctor
                      recommended
                      that I have it surgically altered, either reduced in size or completely removed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Then I found Dr. Allyn. I especially liked her Naturopathic approach of determining the
                        cause
                        and not just treating the symptom.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She suspected I had an iodine deficiency, and the tests she performed proved she was right. She
                      put me on an iodine supplement
                      and the results have been very positive. My throat looks and feels “normal” again. Thanks, Dr.
                      Allyn.</p>

                      humbleness, and integrity are always present.  Being a prudent person, Dr. Allyn displays sound
                      judgment
                      in medical manners.  This was quite evident in her correct diagnosis of my health
                      concerns--namely
                      a gluten issue and a hypo-thyroid condition.

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Dr. Allyn literally saved my life. For many years I saw doctors for various illnesses. I was
                      always
                      having a medical problem. One day I called Dr. Allyn about another condition that had arisen. She
                      answered
                      my question about the newest predicament, but then she called me a few days later. Dr. Allyn had
                      studied
                      my huge file and saw that there was a &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; of sorts. She suggested that I be
                      tested
                      for Lyme disease. She had pieced the puzzle together correctly. I do have Lyme disease.</p>
                    <p>With this diagnosis, I made an appointment with an expert in auto-immune diseases, hoping that
                      he
                      would be of help. I was sadly mistaken. His conclusion was that there was nothing they could do
                      for
                      me. I would just have to live with the horrible things this disease can do.</p>
                    <p>Lucky for me, I had Dr. Allyn on my side. We were able to go outside the box, which was empty of
                      options
                      at this point.</p>
                    <p>At one point my body was so depleted that I did not have the energy to get out of bed. She was
                      able
                      to help me get my immune system working and moving again through the use of herbs, supplements
                      and
                      acupuncture. We used all of the alternatives available to us. She also put me in contact with
                      another
                      physician who was doing some new innovative laser treatment. People were coming to him from all
                      over
                      the world for Lyme disease and other illnesses. She went with me to see him so that we could both
                      learn
                      what he had to offer and how it would work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="emp-text">
                      I am very happy to report that I was bedridden for a time, but now I am 90% back to normal. I am
                      leading a productive, full
                      life, and being able to enjoy all the things I had to put on hold. Without Dr. Allyn’s
                      persistence
                      this would not be possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She likes to work the puzzles and figure out what is wrong, and she is always on the look-out for
                      new solutions. Thank you

                    <p>I was referred to Dr. Allyn by my wife, who was being treated for Hashimoto's. The successes
                      that
                      were being achieved for her, motivated me to also seek Dr. Allyn's advice.  At that time I was on
                      two
                      diabetic prescriptions, two blood pressure prescriptions, one blood thinner, one statin, and one

                      Dr. Allyn converted me to a Paleo/Auto-Immune lifestyle, and also referred me to Dr. Wolfson, the

                      the two doctors' advice, and a Paleo/Auto-Immune lifestyle and exercise, I am now off all

                      have
                      a doctor to consult. An appointment was made and to my dismay, I found myself in an ICU room at a
                      local
                      hospital. The tests that the doctor recommended showed that I had Celiac Sprue. It was something

                      knew nothing about.</p>

                      herbs to take and researched things like toothpaste, mouthwash, medications, etc. containing

                      the
                      problem rather than just treat the symptoms. Naturopathic medicine appealed to me on many levels,

                      importance
                      of steam inhalation to keep my sinus passages healthy. We talked at length about nutrition,

                    <p>I am a 62 year-old male. For a period of almost 10 years, I have struggled with symptoms that
                      got
                      progressively worse and having Doctors repeatedly tell me they could find nothing wrong. One
                      stated
                      that I should be “thankful” for the shape I was in at my age. The only issues that seemed to
                      consistently
                      resurface in lab work was a deficiency in Vitamin D levels, which the Doctors addressed with
                      advice
                      to take an over-the-counter Vitamin D supplement, and some minor elevation in cholesterol levels
                      (deemed
                      typical for someone my age). However, taking Vitamin D supplements did not help with the
                      deficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also struggled with weight issues, unable to get my weigh down into the 180 lb range from over
                      240 lbs. While I was already
                      avoiding all the sugar, sugar substitutes and other bad things such as fried foods (those “evil”
                      dietary
                      no-no’s), this did not seem to help much. I tried two different “Medi...” programs in the area at
                      great
                      expense and loss of my personal time. While I realized small, short-term improvements in weight
                      loss,
                      10-15 lbs. usually, I would reach plateaus below which nothing seemed to work. The weight would
                      return
                      as soon as I would leave the program, and the other symptoms (which I assumed were caused by the
                      excessive
                      weight) would never improve. Brain fog, digestive distress, weakness and feeling tired, loss of
                      mental
                      acuity, hair thinning, and skin aging problems were all slowly getting worse as the years passed.
                      I
                      felt like I was slowly being poisoned, but none of the Doctors I visited were of any help. Due to
                      my
                      age, 58 at the time, I did have a colonoscopy done which came back negative. The
                      gastroenterologist
                      had no explanation for the digestive issues I was having, despite my complaints and clear
                      evidence
                      to the contrary. I was getting very discouraged, because I knew something was very wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>Out of frustration, in December 2015 I began searching for medical studies that addressed the
                      same
                      symptoms I was realizing, and one thing kept surfacing again and again… problems with digestion
                      related
                      to gluten and its effects on body chemistry in general. As I researched further, the subject of
                      “leaky
                      gut syndrome” (intestinal permeability) seemed to also be associated with many of the symptoms
                      from
                      which I was suffering… again with its roots in gluten consumption. So, I began searching for a
                      Doctor
                      with expertise in these things in the greater Phoenix area and visited Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler.
                      While
                      she patiently and compassionately listened I shared my story with her, and we began a journey
                      that
                      has resulted in my feeling 20 years younger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the first 4-6 weeks, only minor change was noted. Then, almost suddenly, my weight started
                      melting off at an amazing
                      rate and my other symptoms began to improve. After about 6 months, I am now down almost 60 lbs to
                      about
                      182 lbs (the same weight I was when I was in the Army 30 years ago!) without any change in
                      exercise
                      habits, without B-12 injections or other physical activity. My energy levels are much improved,
                      and
                      my mind is as sharp now as when I was in college (I am a computer scientist by trade). My
                      digestion
                      is back to normal, my lost hair is growing back, my skin looks much younger and I feel like a
                      different
                      person… all without taking any expensive (and potentially risky) prescription medications! Dr.
                      Allyn
                      also identified a genetic issue I have that addressed the Vitamin D deficiency, in that my body
                      was
                      unable to properly process Vitamin D (which is critical to good health) in the form commonly
                      available
                      as a over-the-counter supplement… something no other Doctor even considered checking over the
                      years.
                      <p class="emp-text">In short, I consider Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler a “God-send”. I cannot speak
                        highly
                        enough of both her genuine concern for me as a patient, and her technical competency. I no
                        longer
                        feel like my health is on a “down-hill slide” and I am looking forward to many more years of
                        active
                        and productive life with my wonderful wife.
                      </p>
                      <p>I am now convinced that the foods we Americans commonly are “sold” in the stores and
                        restaurants
                        are a root cause of many American health issues. I am also convinced that Dr. Allyn is an
                        exceptional
                        healer, and worthy of my highest endorsement.

                    <p>I am a 37 year old male. I highly recommend Dr. Krieger-Fiedler. When I first came to see Dr.
                      Krieger-Fiedler,
                      I was very tired, not just ordinary tired. I had trouble getting out of bed in the morning even
                      after
                      ten hours of sleep. My medical doctor said I was just fine due to their blood test. So I had
                      several
                      blood tests and food sensitivity tests with Dr. Krieger-Fiedler and found out what the real
                      problems
                      were. I was allergic to hops, beets, cottonseed, egg whites to name a few. After eliminating
                      these
                      foods I feel great. </p>
                    <p class="emp-text">
                      With Dr. Krieger-Fiedler’s attention I feel relief and have energy like I was 18 years old.
                      Mentally, I feel much more clear
                      and experience more self-confidence and strength. I feel balanced and energized! I recommend
                      Naturopathic

                    <p>I had been suffering from the effects of Latent Celiac disease for several years and had been to
                      numerous
                      doctors around the country in an effort to deal with the myriad of symptoms resulting from that
                      disease.
                        None of the doctors I worked with were able to diagnose this issue and the severe health
                      problems
                      associated with Celiac Disease persisted for almost two years.  I noticed an article in the local
                      Fountain
                      Hills newspaper about a support group that dealt with health issues run by Dr. Allyn.   My
                      husband
                      and I attended that session and after participating I decided to schedule an appointment with
                      her.
                       The rest is history!!  Allyn tested me for food allergies, determined that I had sensitivities
                      to
                      numerous foods, found that I had Latent Celiac Disease, prescribed supplements for me, changed my
                      diet
                      and got my life back on track.  </p>
                    <p class="emp-text">It is hard to describe how much my quality of life improved through her
                      determined

                      highest
                      standards for what is expected from a health professional and I would recommend her to anyone who
                      needs
                      help with their overall health.   My husband has also worked with Allyn and his health and life

                    <p>I was suffering from frequent urination for many years. After seeing many doctors (MD’s), doing
                      test
                      after test and trying many medications, to no avail, I contacted Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler (NMD).

                      suspected I may have some food allergies. I took a panel of food and chemical allergy tests and

                    <p>Dear Dr. Allyn,
                      <p>Just a short note to let you know how extraordinary my experiences with you have been.
                        Naturopathic
                        medicine has given me the tools to become and remain a healthy person. The time and attention
                        and
                        true caring at your office are wonderful. I feel comfortable knowing that I can call or email
                        you
                        with questions or problems and know that you’re always there for me.</p>
                      <p>It’s not just another visit to the doctor, it’s an education provided in a serene,
                        professional
                        environment. Health issues I thought I’d have to live with the rest of my life have greatly
                        improved
                        or, in the case of my psoriasis, are completely cured. I appreciate the wide variety of tools
                        you
                        have provided me---books, pamphlets, websites and clinical testing.
                      </p>
                      <p>Once I learned how to look at nutrition and supplements differently, I realized there’s no
                        going
                        back to the old ways.</p>
                      <p>Your genuine caring, compassion and knowledge have made getting and staying healthy easier and
                        pleasant.
                        My hope is that everyone could find the same.</p>

                    <p>After 2 years, numerous doctors and a trip to the Mayo Clinic, I found Dr. Krieger-Fiedler. I
                      battled
                      with a severe thyroid issue that I could never seem to get medicated properly. Dr.
                      Krieger-Fiedler
                      ran much more extensive tests and put me on a natural alternative to traditional thyroid
                      medicines
                      that have been working wonders for the last 2 years. She is without a doubt the most
                      knowledgeable
                      physician that I have met regarding thyroid problems. She is caring, compassionate and readily
                      available
                      to her patients. She has changed my life!</p>

                    <p>Dr. Allyn helped me enormously. After worsening under the care of a highly credentialed, well
                      known
                      western M.D., my mother suggested I try a Naturopath. I had no idea what to expect. The
                      experience
                      changed my life forever. Not only was Dr. Allyn quickly able to put her finger on the medical
                      problem,
                      but she was also able to identify several other contributing factors that were aggravating the
                      situation.
                      The treatments that she offered and the lifestyle changes that she encouraged were natural and in
                      synch
                      with my body. With Dr. Allyn’s help I was gradually able to get off of all thyroid medication and
                      rebalance
                      my endocrine system. I am now completely well and healthier than I ever would have imagined
                      possible,
                      thanks to Dr. Allyn.</p>

                      caring
                      person. So when she decided to pursue the Naturopathic health care field, I knew that this would

                      over in her work. She always takes the time to understand your needs, never rushes you and gives
                      you
                      information to read so you have better knowledge of your issues. Unlike medical doctors, Dr.
                      Allyn
                      tries to help you solve your ailments without drugs that could do more harm than good. With

                    <p>I have been Dr. Krieger-Fiedler’s patient since 1998, when she resolved my debilitating heavy
                      menstrual
                      bleeding problem. A gynecologist wanted to cut out my uterus but I thought there must be a less
                      drastic
                      option and Dr. Krieger-Fiedler had it. After testing me for food sensitivities, bacteria and
                      yeast
                      overgrowth, she put me on a protocol of diet, nutritional supplements and natural remedies. After
                      4
                      months I was felling better so I was not faithful with the diet.</p>
                    <p>Recently, I was suffering with extreme fatigue, depression, acid reflux, migraines, joint pain
                      and
                      weight gain. Dr. Krieger-Fiedler ordered a complete thyroid panel which showed that I had an
                      autoimmune
                      thyroid disease called Hashimoto’s. Her next step was to figure out why antibodies were attacking
                      my
                      thyroid. Past experience prompted Dr. Krieger-Fiedler to investigate whether or not gluten
                      sensitivity
                      may be the reason for the hyperactive immune system. Further testing confirmed her suspicions. I
                      began
                      a protocol of thyroid medication and a gluten free diet. All my symptoms soon started to resolve.
                      After
                      8 months I was able to shed 30 pounds without starving myself. It is amazing to me how all of my
                      symptoms
                      were linked to diet. I have felt better in the past year than I have in the past decade.
                      Therefore,
                      I will not stray from my diet in the future. It just isn’t worth the suffering.

                    <p>About four years ago, I was very frustrated with traditional medical doctors because they didn't
                      address
                      how awful I felt (like hitting a wall). Some of my problems were caused by Hashimoto's disease. I
                      found
                      Dr. Allyn, who really listened to what I told her and had me tested for several other possible
                      conditions
                      that could have contributed to the misery. Because of her thoroughness, I found I had gluten,
                      dairy
                      and corn intolerance in addition to the thyroid issue. Since changing my diet and thyroid

                    <p>Dr. Krieger-Fiedler has been the reason why I enjoy good health in my sixties. A few years ago I
                      was
                      not feeling well…lethargic and no energy. She determined that the problem was due to my low
                      immune
                      system, and immediately set forth in pumping that up. With supplements and diet, she had me begin
                      a
                      protocol with emphasis on my having a more balanced gut with good bacteria, rather than bad
                      bacteria.
                      It was successful and I felt like a new person.</p>
                    <p>I was again feeling very tired some years later and she determined that I was hypothyroid. I
                      began
                      a regimen of natural thyroid supplements and I’m on top of the world again. She has gained a
                      reputation
                      of being extremely knowledgeable in the area of thyroid hormone treatment. She has treated me
                      successfully
                      for a variety of symptoms, from estrogen replacement to clearing up a urinary tract infection,
                      all
                      with natural products. Although she uses natural protocols, alongside her treatment, she uses

                    <p>I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Krieger-Fiedler. She is extremely knowledgeable, has a

                    <p>Dr. Allyn was a breath of fresh air after several "conventional" medical doctors knew nothing
                      about
                      how to improve my declining health. I spent my new engagement and first part of my new marriage
                      with
                      too many awful symptoms to list. Dr. Allyn was able to diagnose Hashimoto's disease and adrenal
                      fatigue
                      and set me on the right path. She listened carefully and provided thoughtful suggestions on what
                      to
                      test and how to treat. We worked on increasing the diversity of my microbiome, changed to a
                      natural
                      thyroid med, made necessary diet/lifestyle changes, identified nutritional deficiencies and added
                      vitamin/mineral
                      supplementation. Dr. Allyn started me on a life-long journey of health through holistic healing.
                      I
                      will never go back to my "old life". I am forever grateful to Dr. Allyn for sharing her knowledge
                      and
                      insight in such an empathetic way. She has a special way where she combines professionalism with
                      a
                      sweet personal touch. I highly recommend her!

                  <blockquote>
                    <P>My name is Tami and I am a flight attendant for our local airline. I have been flying for 13
                      years.
                      I thought I was in permanent jet lag. I had no energy. I had huge sugar cravings and was over
                      weight.</P>
                    <P>I met Dr. Allyn at an Iodine seminar that my sister was attending and I talked to her briefly,
                      telling
                      her I wanted to get healthy from the inside out and she thought she could help me and gave me her
                      business
                      card. I called her a couple of months later and we set up an appointment. She ordered several
                      tests
                      and after we got the results back she found an overgrowth of candida albicans and klebsiella
                      pneumonia
                      and no growth of lactobacillus. She also found that I was very low on iodine.</P>
                    <P>Dr. Allyn put together a custom prescription to treat the overgrowth of pathogens and to correct
                      the
                      lack of lactobacillus and iodine. It included a detox diet for a few weeks, continued by a yeast
                      free
                      diet following that and treating the pathogens. I had to have an ultrasound of my thyroid before
                      I
                      started taking the iodine supplement. That revealed some spots on my thyroid. Dr. Allyn said not
                      to
                      worry. The iodine should take care of that. We continue to monitor my thyroid with ultrasounds.</P>
                    <P>I then started the program that she had laid out for me. We retested in a few weeks and found
                      some
                      new organism which she treated. I continued on the program for about 8 or 9 months and then we
                      found
                      that the pathogens were gone but that I still had no lactobacillus. I will continue to take a
                      custom
                      probiotic for that for quite a while.</P>
                    <P>We also tested my thyroid function with blood work which revealed that I had Hashimoto’s
                      disease.
                      I started taking thyroid medication (Nature-Throid) for the Hashimoto’s disease.</P>
                    <P>I have now lost 13 pounds with the program Dr. Allyn prescribed for me and I have so much more
                      energy
                      since starting the Nature-Throid. I feel so much better and had no idea I had so many things
                      going
                      on in my body.</P>
                    <P>I had other issues during that year, like a cat bite that became infected. Dr. Allyn called me
                      every
                      day to see how I was doing. She also did research to see what other things I could do to help
                      with
                      the infection and healing other than the antibiotics I had to take. She has always been there
                      when
                      I needed her. I don’t know how I got along this long without her.</P>
                    <P>I continue to see Dr. Allyn and we plan to continue to see what other issues I may not know
                      about,
                      like possible food allergies and whatever we decide I need to check out based on any symptoms I
                      may
                      have.
                    </P>
                    <P>Dr. Allyn thanks for always being there and for being my friend.
                    </P>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Dr. Allyn has been an extremely knowledgeable and helpful guide on my path to wellness. I live
                      overseas
                      and am only in the Phoenix area for a few weeks out of the year, but she was willing to work with
                      me
                      and was very accommodating of my tight schedule. She recommended tests that I would have never
                      been
                      able to get from a traditionally trained Western physician. Between her listening skills and the
                      tests
                      that she subsequently ordered, we had the necessary information that was needed to improve my
                      health.
                      She also follows up with me online to see how I am progressing and we have had consultations via
                      Skype
                      when necessary.</p>
                    <p>I am very pleased with the care and compassion that she has for her patients and I am grateful
                      that
                      I decided to see her. One appointment with her going over the test results, gave me more
                      information
                      than I had gotten in seeing regular doctors over the last 20 plus years. I wish I had known about
                      naturopathic
                      medicine and Dr. Allyn sooner!</p>

                    <p>Naturopathic medicine is my choice for health care. After years of allopathic care (where the
                      attitude
                      was &ldquo;sorry, no answer, no cure, try this pill&rdquo;), Dr. Allyn quickly diagnosed that I
                      had
                      chronic Lyme disease. Now, I am free of its symptoms and only need to take a simple herb daily.</p>
                    <p>With Dr. Allyn’s thorough testing and analysis she empowered me with knowledge to control my
                      food
                      allergies. I can now make informed food decisions and identify the additives that are detrimental
                      to
                      my health.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Allyn also provides additional support through informational resources such as cookbooks,
                      cooking
                      and gardening tips and updates on new medical information.</p>
                    <p>I feel that I am now in charge of my health because I am supported by Dr. Allyn’s knowledge and
                      dedication.

                    <p>I am grateful to have Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler in my life.
